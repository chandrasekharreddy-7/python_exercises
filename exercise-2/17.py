''' Q17 : Grading of Steel
A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:
(i) Hardness must be greater than 50
(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600
The grades are assigned as follows:
• Grade 10: All three conditions are satisfied
• Grade 9: Conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied
2

• Grade 8: Conditions (ii) and (iii) are satisfied
• Grade 7: Conditions (i) and (iii) are satisfied
• Grade 6: Only one condition is satisfied
• Grade 5: None of the conditions are satisfied
Write a program that takes as input the hardness, carbon content, and tensile strength of
the steel and prints the grade of the steel. '''
# hardness = float(input("Enter hardness: "))
# carbon = float(input("Enter carbon content: "))
# tensile = float(input("Enter tensile strength: "))

# c1 = hardness > 50
# c2 = carbon < 0.7
# c3 = tensile > 5600

# if c1 and c2 and c3:
#     grade = 10
# elif c1 and c2:
#     grade = 9
# elif c2 and c3:
#     grade = 8
# elif c1 and c3:
#     grade = 7
# elif c1 or c2 or c3:
#     grade = 6
# else:
#     grade = 5

# print("Grade of steel:", grade)
